Simple Xbox gamepad tracker for streaming.

## Setup

- Download the files as ZIP and extract it, and keep these ones under a same directory: `xboxpadviewer.html`, `mapping.css`, `options.js`, `dot.png`.  
  You can make changes on colors, fade-out times, etc. in `options.js`.  
  Then you can capture the html file in your broadcasting software.
- Or, without downloading them you can load [the hosted html page](https://dinir.github.io/xbox-pad-viewer/xboxpadviewer.html) directly from the program.

Width and height for the viewer is 178x77.  
Press any key on the gamepad after plugging it in and the viewer will start showing the buttons.
