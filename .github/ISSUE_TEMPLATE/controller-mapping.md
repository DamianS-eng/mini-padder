**Controller Info and Usages**
<!--What is this controller made for? If you can't connect it directly to a computer, how do you make it work? Would the mapping be the same regardless of how the controller is connected? Are there games of which it is popular among the players?-->

**Mapping**
```json
Remove this placeholder text and paste the mapping here. It should starts and ends like this:
  "054c09cc": {
    "name": "Wireless Controller",
    "properties": [],
    ...
      "shoulder": {
        "l1": 4,
        "r1": 5,
        "l2": 6,
        "r2": 7
      }
    }
  }
```

**Stick Inputs <!--required under condition-->**
<!--If the stick or d-pad of the controller has an option to switch its input type, please describe which axes or button indexes the input of each type is sent to. I recommend visiting https://gamepad-tester.com/ to check them. Not required for controllers with a d-pad and two sticks.-->
Type | Axis/Button Indexes
---- | -------------------
D-pad | Write_Indexes_Here
Left Stick | Write_Indexes_Here
Right Stick | Write_Indexes_Here
